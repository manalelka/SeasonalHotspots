Next steps : 

- Most used tags.
- ~~Most visited places (make sure to not take into account the location "Helsinki")~~ mostly just helsinki in the 100k file..
- ~~For the most visited locations, when do people visit them the most ?~~ this goes with the previous point
- For the most used tags, when do people use them the most?
- Impact on the covid situation on summer tourism.

FYI : we need to scrape more data --> best if we could scrape data from June to August.

Tasks :

- Classification algorithm : to predict most used tags/locations, probably more --> Manal (scikit learn)
- Figure out when people visit locations and use tags the most --> Manal / Valeri 
- Clustering algorithm : let the machine do the classification by itself --> Olavi (scikit learn)
- Scrape 200k rows --> Olavi 
- Get info about the "cool" and interactive visualization tools : seaborn python, streamlit --> Valeri 
- WORK ON THE PITCH!!! (12/10) --> probably meet on next Thursday :)
