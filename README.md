 Our application is a data analysis tool that allows to find areas in Helsinki with a high tourist density or provide a better understanding about the region’s activities in general. The customer segment is cities’ councils or other regional public actors. To limit the scope of this project we selected the city of Helsinki. However, we would be open to testing our application on bigger cities, and therefore, more data. 

The initial idea behind this is to scrape pictures from Instagram, which is a photo-sharing platform and social network where users upload photos for others to see. Each picture has a date, a location, and an amount of tags. 

This information would allow us to figure out the city’s hotspots for each season based on the date when the picture was taken. The tags would be useful to sort out the different attractions of the city and the centers of interest.
